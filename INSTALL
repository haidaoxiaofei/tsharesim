Required libraries:
	- lpsolve (http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/)

Compiling:
	make

Executing:
	./simulator algorithm_selection [maximum passengers] [number taxis] [constraint scale factor]
	 
	 algorithm_selection
	 	0 for branch and bound
	 	1 for brute force
	 	2 for mixed integer programming
	 	3 for basic tree
	 	4 for tree with slack time
	 	5 for tree with slack time, clustering
 	maximum passengers: maximum passengers assigned to taxi at a time
 		default is 4
	number taxis: number of taxis to simulate
		default is 20,000
	constraint scale factor (percentage): multiplied by SERVICE_CONST and PICKUP_CONST defined in simulator.cpp
		default is 100
